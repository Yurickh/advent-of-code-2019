# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions for the advent of code in 2019, which I decided to do using [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io) for learning reasons.

If you have critique regarding my solutions and have a better suggestion, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Yurickh/advent-of-code-2019/issues/new) or, even better, [a pull request](https://github.com/Yurickh/advent-of-code-2019/compare).

## Running

Each challenge day is represented by a test suite in its `src/dayXX` folder.

You can run the tests of a specific day `XX` by running

```bash
# be sure to replace XX with the relevant day
yarn test dayXX
```

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress :p~
